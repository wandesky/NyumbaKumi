# NyumbaKumi
Web platform for nyumba kumi. (Initial idea: 18th April 2019)
This project attempts to make use of technology in implementation of the Nyumba Kumi initiative.
The application connects all the stakeholders using a web based platform that enhances 
flow of information among the three.

# Stakeholders
To start with, I have identified the following three stakeholders;
* Chief: Administrator of Nyumba Kumi within his/her territory
* Elder: Leads the Nyumba kumi in that particular area
* Tenant: A member of a pack of approx. ten others under one elder

# How the app works
## Roaming mode
When a person moves into a new location, the mobile app immediately notifies them which 
location they currently are in and also the name and contacts of the chief in that location.
The following information can be obtained by a roaming user:
* Chief: Name and contact of the (sub-)chief in that (sub-)location.
* OCS: Name of nearest police station and the contacts of the officer in charge of that station
* Elder: Name and contact of Nyumba Kumi elder in that area.
In case of any emergency or need to report an incident, the user can seamlessy inform any or all
of the above mentioned users by writing a message on the mobile app which gets broadcasted or in 
case of emergency, directly call any of the numbers for help.

## Tenancy mode
### Requesting to join new pack
When a person moves into a new residency, they have an option to request for admittance to a
Nyumba kumi pack. The process to request for tenancy works as follows:
1. A new tenants arrives at their new home
2. They open the NyumbaKumi app and request for new pack
3. The GPS coordinates of the new tenant's home are picked and sent together with the _*' join' *_ request.
4. The chief receives the request and based on GPS coord's is able to send a notification to the nearest elder
5. The nearest elder receives the application and accepts/rejects the new tenant

### Communicating with the NyumbaKumi pack
1. Opens the app and joins the group chat
2. Shares any information that may be of interest/concern to other members e.g. report suspicious activity
or raise concern about negligence in garbage collection in recent weeks.

### Raising alarm
Directly send message to elder, chief and ocs; usually in emergency situations or reporting imminent danger.

## Elder mode
A person with an elder account is able to perform the following functions;
1. Escalate matters raised in the pack to be addressed by the chief
2. Moderate conversations in the packs group chat
3. Give weekly/monthly summary of security situation in the pack

## Chief mode
1. Assign new elder status
2. Moderate elders chatting platform
3. Escalate matters raised in elders platform to relevant authorities e.g. company responsible for garbage collection
can be warned if they keep spilling garbage that their licence will be revoked or ask OCS to increase patrols in a 
particular area facing increase in criminal activities.
